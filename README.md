#Question
How do house prices influence consumption in the Netherlands?

#Motivation
Consumption is a major component of GDP, in fact in 2013 it represented approximately 68% of total GDP in the Netherlands [Eurostat](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=nama_fcs_c&lang=en). As explained by the life cycle hypothesis [Modigliani, 1966] (https://www.jstor.org/stable/40969831?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) and the permanent income hypothesis [Friedman, 1957] (http://papers.nber.org/books/frie57-1), consumption is determined by a person’s expected income. Individuals tend to adjust their consumption based on the idea that they do not like periods of abundance and deprivation, instead, they prefer a relatively smooth consumption level. 

Housing is probably the most important single asset an individual (or household) will own in his life. For the Dutch population, housing represented between 45% and 73% of a households’ total assets in 1997 (https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/535786/55.pdf). The relevance of housing on an individual’s can be seen in Figure 1, which shows the ratio of residential loans to disposable income of Dutch households. The high ratio (well above the European average) is probably related to the high optimism the Dutch have on the state of the economy. Data from the Central Bureau of Statistics shows that 53% of the population had “a little or a lot to spare” in the last quarter of 2016. Just as consumption, the demand for housing depends on the income an individual expects to have in the future (Attanasio and Browning, 1993 http://www.nber.org/papers/w4453.pdf ) and other macroeconomic factors such as the interest rates and development of the financial sector (Benito et al. 2006   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/qb060201.pdf  and Tsatsaronis and Zhu, 2004 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1968425 ).

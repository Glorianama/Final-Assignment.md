How do house prices influence consumption in the Netherlands?

#Motivation
Consumption is a major component of GDP, in fact in 2013 it represented approximately 68% of total GDP in the Netherlands (Eurostat). As explained by the life cycle hypothesis [Modigliani, 1966] (https://www.jstor.org/stable/40969831?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) and the permanent income hypothesis [Friedman, 1957] (http://papers.nber.org/books/frie57-1), consumption is determined by a personâ€™s expected income. Individuals tend to adjust their consumption based on the idea that they do not like periods of abundance and deprivation, instead, they prefer a relatively smooth consumption level.
